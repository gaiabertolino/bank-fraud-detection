# Anomaly Detection with Machine Learning

#### Keywords

`Anomaly Detection`, `Machine Learning`, `Unsupervised Learning`, `Outlier Detection`, `Data Analysis`, `Clustering`, `Statistical Methods`, `Python`, `Jupyter Notebook`.

This project focuses on the **detection of anomalous patterns in data** using machine learning and statistical techniques. The objective is to identify observations that deviate significantly from normal behavior, which may indicate errors, rare events, or abnormal system conditions.

The analysis is conducted in a **Jupyter Notebook** environment and explores multiple anomaly detection approaches, comparing their effectiveness on the same dataset. The project emphasizes **unsupervised and semi-supervised methods**, making it suitable for scenarios where labeled anomalies are scarce or unavailable.

This project was developed as part of an academic coursework in **Data Analysis / Machine Learning**.
